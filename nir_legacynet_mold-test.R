# Intro -------------------------------------------------------------------

# We took subsamples from plots after our last forage harvest (Sep2022).
# we dried these samples in paper bags at 140F, but they molded
# to what extent does the mold impact the NIR predcitions?

# we randomly selected 3 bags that contained rotted biomass
# on the top and edges of the forage mass the sorghum sudangrass had not molded
# in the center there was mold
# in between the edges and middle there was a mixture of mold

# There are 3 levels of mold. 

# 1 = no mold. These were the dried green leaves at edge of sample that dried down
# fast and did not mold

# 2 = mixture of mold and no mold. If we had left these samples in the oven for weeks, the
# sample would've eventually dried and the center would've been blacker in color
# and the outside greener. I would've just grabbed a mix of these samples, this
# is what 2 represents

# 3 = mold. Sample was taken from center. Dark in color

# There are 3 plots, randomly selected. All had been dried for 1 week at 140F
# and shuffled a number of times and still molded
