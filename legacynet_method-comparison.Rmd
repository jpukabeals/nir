# Conclusion

The common predicted values between UMN and Europe were crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). 

These forage quality parameters were adjusted to a percent of dry matter basis

We only have a comparison of one cutting, which was taken on 14Sep2022 of sorghum sudangrass. 

At this stage, the sorghum sudangrass was near heading. Some seedheads were fully emerged. 

At this stage, we predict CP~9, ADF~40, NDF~65. 

UMN underestimated CP, ADF and NDF relative to Europe and what we expected to observe.
