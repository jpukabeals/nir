On 14Sep2022, we collected forage quality samples from a sorghum sudangrass stand as part of the LegacyNet experiment. We processed and then predicted forage quality using the Hay equation with our Perten NIRS at UMN. Then we shipped the samples to Europe where they predicted forage quality using their Foss NIRS. Here we compare the predictions. 

The common predicted values between UMN and Europe were crude protein (CP), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF). 

These forage quality parameters were adjusted to a percent of dry matter basis.

Based on the maturity of the Sorghum Sudangrass at the time of cutting, we predict CP~9, ADF~40, NDF~65 for the plants with emerged seed heads and CP~11, ADF~35 NDF~60 for the less mature plants. 

We conclude that UMN underestimates CP, ADF and NDF relative to Europe and relative to what we expected to observe.
